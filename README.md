<h2 align="center"> About </h2>
<p> The main goal is to present all SOLID patterns in a complete way using java, thus creating a strong foundation for future projects. </p>
<br>

<h2 align="center">Form of Approach</h2>
<p> We will present a scenario in which a certain design pattern fits well, so that it becomes apparent what functionality and what the pattern should be implemented for. As this is a guide specifically to the SOLID patterns, it will be divided into three subfolders: Behavioral, Creational and Structural. </p>
<br>

<h2 align="center"> Patterns Already Implemented </h2>

- Behavioral
  - Strategy
  - Chain of Responsability
  
- Creational
  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Abstract Factory
  
- Structural
  - Proxy
  - Adapter

<p>*Note: They are ordered according to what I would learn first*</p>
